6.5. Creating Directories

It is time to create some structure in the LFS file system. Create a standard directory tree by issuing the following commands:

root@Minty ~ # chroot "$LFS" /tools/bin/env -i \
>     HOME=/root                  \
>     TERM="$TERM"                \
>     PS1='\u:\w\$ '              \
>     PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/tools/bin \
>     /tools/bin/bash --login +h
